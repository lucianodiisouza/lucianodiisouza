## Hi, I'm Luciano dii Souza 🇧🇷  
A Brazilian Software Engineer passionate about building things with JavaScript and creating content about tech and career growth. I specialize in frontend and mobile development, always exploring new technologies—and yes, I have a soft spot for mechanical keyboards.  

### 💻 Experienced with:  
JavaScript, TypeScript, React, React Native, Next.js, Node.js, Tailwind, Styled-Components, Bootstrap, PHP, Delphi (yeah, I’ve seen things...), and Ruby on Rails (miss you 🫡).  

### 🚀 Currently working with:  
React and React Native at @workl , helping build great digital experiences.  

### 📍 Currently in Brazil, but moving to England soon!  

### 📚 Currently learning:  
Swift / SwiftUI / C (??? Let's see where this goes...)  

### 🎥 Content Creation:  
I create videos and posts about software development, career tips, and tech insights—sometimes with a touch of humor.  

### 🔍 A bit about my journey:  
I started my career navigating through different stacks, from Delphi and PHP to JavaScript and modern web frameworks. Over time, I specialized in frontend and mobile development, working on projects that impact real users. Now, I’m exploring new languages, sharing knowledge through content, and preparing for my next chapter in London.
